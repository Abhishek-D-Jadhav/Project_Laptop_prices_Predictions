This project is about predict laptop prices using a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning pipeline to predict laptop prices. 
The process involves loading and preprocessing the data, followed by exploratory data analysis and data visualization. I have then split the data into training set and test set and then scaled the features to prepare them for machine learning.
Here i hace also looked at the feature importances of the Random forest model, then performed residual analysis by plotting the residuals.
